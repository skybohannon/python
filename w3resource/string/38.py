# 38. Write a Python program to count occurrences of a substring in a string.

str1 = "FYI man, alright. You could sit at home, and do like absolutely nothing, and your name goes through like 17 computers a day. 1984? Yeah right, man. That's a typo. Orwell is here now. He's livin' large. We have no names, man. No names. We are nameless!"

print(str1.count("man"))
